title: "Fast Simulation-Based Power Analyses for Mixed-Effects Models"
abstract: |
   Simulation is the gold standard for power analysis of mixed-effects models.
    Traditionally, realistic simulations have been both hard to set up and computationally intractable.
    Here we present a Julia-based workflow for fast and easy power analysis of mixed-effects models.
    With MixedModelsSim.jl, we can easily simulate realistic datasets, which we can then quickly analyze with MixedModels.jl.
    Combined with Pluto.jl, users can explore the impact on power of design decisions interactively.
